## Assignment Introduction:

● In this week student will be a given a set of problem statement on linked list
● A set of problems statement on stack and queue

## Benchmarks

● All the problem should have an optimize solutions
● All the problem statement should have the time and space complexity mention in the code comment
● The code should be readable and must follow good coding practice.
● Keep the code as modular as you can.

## Instructor evaluation guidelines:

● Was the person able to understand what the question was asking?
● Were they able to find the brute force solution? Were they able to find a better solution or the optimal one?
● Did they consider the tradeoffs of a certain approach? Did they consider edge cases?
● How successful were they at translating their ideas into workable code?
● Was their code readable and well-structured?
● Were they concerned about the quality of code in their solution?
● Did they pay close attention to detail?

## Learning Outcomes:

● Student will learn how to implement a linked list and iterate through linked list
● Students will learn to code stack and queue
● Student will be understand when to implement a stack or a queue in a given problem statement
● Students will be able to solve easy to medium level array problem
