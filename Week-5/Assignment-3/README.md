# Week 5 - Assignment 3

[Welcome to Pesto assignment - 3 from the Week 5](https://pestotech.teachable.com/courses/1782350/lectures/40231574)

Write a function called hasDuplicate which accepts an array and returns true or false if that array contains a duplicate

## Guidelines
1. Reference:
```
hasDuplicate([1,5,-1,4]) // false
const hasDuplicate = arr => new Set(arr).size !== arr.length
```
2. JS function should have Set API implemented.
3. Bonus - if space and time complexity is taken care.

## Outcome
1. Understanding of Set API and its functionalities.
