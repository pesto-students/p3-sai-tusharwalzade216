# Week 4 - Assignment 3

[Welcome to Pesto assignment - 3 from the Week 4](https://pestotech.teachable.com/courses/1782350/lectures/40231555)

Implement Fibonacci Series with Iterators

## Sample output:

<pre>
The Fibonacci Series is:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
</pre>

## Guidelines:

1. The expected output should be achieved using Iterators only.
2. Reference: https://medium.com/@akshayshekokar/fibonacci-series-with-iterators-90a8b3dd0d92
3. For Loops, Maps should not have been used.
4. 3rd party libraries should not have been used.

## Outcome:

1. Understanding how Iterators work.
2. Understanding 'under the hood' implementation of Iterators.
