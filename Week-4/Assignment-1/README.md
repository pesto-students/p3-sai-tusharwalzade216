# Week 4 - Assignment 1

[Welcome to Pesto assignment - 1 from the Week 4](https://pestotech.teachable.com/courses/1782350/lectures/40231555)

Implement a function namedgetNumber which generates a random number. If randomNumber is divisible by 5 it will reject the promise else it will resolve the promise. Let’s also keep the promise resolution/rejection time as a variable.

1. JS promises should not be used.
2. A custom promise function should be created.
3. This function should be able to handle all 3 states Resolve, Reject and Fulfilled.
4. Should be able to accept callbacks as props.

## Guidelines:

1. JS promises should not be used.
2. 3rd party libraries should not be used.
3. Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
4. The program should execute without errors.
5. The program should achieve the desired result.
6. The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.
7. Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.

## Outcome:

1. Under the hood understanding of how a promise actually works.
2. Using “bind” to bind the callback functions sent as props.
3. Understanding what a polyfill is.
4. Error handling using functions.
