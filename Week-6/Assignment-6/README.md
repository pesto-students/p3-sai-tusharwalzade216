## 3 sum

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. Assume that there will only be one solution.

Example:

given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
