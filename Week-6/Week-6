## Week 6

### Assignment Introduction
- Calculate the time and space complexity for the set of questions
- A set of Problem statement based on array that would help student how to iterate and process an array

### Benchmarks
- All the problem should have an optimize solutions
- All the problem statement should have the time and space complexity mention in the code comment
- The code should be readable and must follow good coding practice.
- Keep the code as modular as you can.

### Learning Outcomes
- Student will have a good grip on calculating time and space complexity of given loop or program
- Students will learn how to iterate and process array
- Students will learn how to use Two pointer and Kadane Algorithm to optimize code.
- Students will be able to solve easy to medium level array problem
