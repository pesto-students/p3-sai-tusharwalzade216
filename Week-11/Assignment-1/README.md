# Week 11 - Assignment 1

[Welcome to Pesto assignment - 1 from the Week 11](https://pestotech.teachable.com/courses/1782350/lectures/40231475)

In this Assignment, you will need to deploy your URL shortener to a web server.

Deploy a production build to web server of your choice. You can choose any free deployment solution.

The web application should be accessible by a hostname. Example: Netlify

All the workflows should work as expected.

## Benchmarks:

1. Before deployment, do performance benchmarking (checking render cycles and memory consumption).

2. Try to reduce render cycles as much as possible with optimization techniques like using pure components

3. Create a .ReadME file with all the commands for prod deployment

4. The application should be running on a cloud webserver.

5. Include the hostname of the deployed web application in the readMe file.

6. Push the readMe to the github repo
