## Assignment Introduction:

● In this week student will be a given a set of problem statement on graph and trees

## Benchmarks

● All the problem should have an optimize solutions

● All the problem statement should have the time and space complexity mention in the code comment

● The code should be readable and must follow good coding practice.

● Keep the code as modular as you can

## Instructor evaluation guidelines:

● Was the person able to understand what the question was asking?

● Were they able to find the brute force solution? Were they able to find a better solution or the optimal one?

● Did they consider the tradeoffs of a certain approach? Did they consider edge cases?

● How successful were they at translating their ideas into workable code?

● Was their code readable and well-structured?

● Were they concerned about the quality of code in their solution?

● Did they pay close attention to detail?

## Learning Outcomes:

● Student will learn how to implement a graph and trees

● Student will learn and implement code to iterate and search node through agraph and tree

● Students will learn and implement various graph traversal method
